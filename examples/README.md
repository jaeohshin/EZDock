# Examples

This folder contains some examples of using the EZDock pipeline. In each folder, there is a README.md file that guides the user on how to run the codes to replicate the results seen.

Note: The BALM folder may contain examples using only the Vina pipeline i.e., the code does not contain any functionality implemented by OpenEye Toolkits.
